## 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts house prices using various features such as lot size, number of rooms, neighborhood, and other real estate attributes. The dataset is based on the popular **Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset.

---

### 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can predict the final sale price of homes. The dataset contains detailed information for over 1,400 residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
